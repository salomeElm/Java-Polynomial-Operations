# Java Polynomial Operations
A Java program that models polynomials using objects and performs operations like addition, subtraction, derivative, and equality check.

## Features
- Models polynomials using term objects  
- Adds, subtracts, and differentiates polynomials  
- Compares polynomials for equality  
- Interactive console input for polynomial creation  

## How to Run
1. Ensure Java 8 or above is installed.  
2. Compile all `.java` files.  
3. Run `PolynomMain` from your terminal or IDE.  
4. Follow the console prompts to enter two polynomials.

## Files
- `Polynom.java` – Represents a full polynomial and includes all operations.  
- `PolyTerm.java` – Represents a single term in a polynomial (coefficient + exponent).  
- `PolynomMain.java` – Console-based interface for user input and displaying results.  

## Example Input
```
How many terms does the first polynomial have?
3
Enter the coefficient of term 1:
2
Enter the exponent of term 1:
3
...
```
